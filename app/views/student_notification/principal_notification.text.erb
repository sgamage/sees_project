Dear <%= @school.principal_name%>

 

F.A.O <%= @school.principal_name%>

 

This email is to notify you that <%= @student.full_name %> has submitted an application to the University of Sydney's Early Offer Year 12 scheme (E12). This is an early conditional offer scheme, with a number of support benefits attached to it.

For further information on E12 you can view our website at: http://sydney.edu.au/future_students/domestic_undergraduate/e12/index.shtml

In order for your student's application to be eligible you are asked to consider their application and if in support of the student complete a Principal's Supporting Application. The closing date for  applications is 5pm 7 September 2012. 

For step by step instructions for Principal go to the E12 website at:

Your supporting application will take approximately five to ten minutes to complete. All of the student's details are auto-filled, including the course they are applying for. One supporting application is required for each student and you can support up to ten students in your school.

You will need to enter the email address this was first sent to in order to setup your password.  To complete the supporting application select the link below:

If you are not in support of a student's application we ask that you log in and select "no" to this question. This is at the start of the application. 
To help you keep track of the students from your school who have applied, you can access an application status page, which lists all of the students who have applied from your school and allows you to view their applications online.
Once your supporting application is submitted no further revisions or re-submissions can be made. We may contact you to discuss some of the details in your supporting application.

 

Thank-you for taking the time to consider students for E12.
