Dear <%= @school.principal_name%>,

 

This email is to notify you that <<Student Name>> has submitted an application to the University of Sydney's Early Offer Year 12 (E12) scheme. This is an early conditional offer scheme, with a number of support benefits attached to it.

For further information on E12 you can view our website at: http://sydney.edu.au/future_students/domestic_undergraduate/e12/index.shtml

In order for the  student's  application to be eligible you are required to complete a Principal's Supporting Application. The closing date for  applications is the 7th  September 2012. 

For step by step instructions for Principals go to the E12 website at:

http://sydney.edu.au/future_students/domestic_undergraduate/e12/principals.shtml

 

The application should only take five and ten minutes to complete. All of the student's details are auto-filled, including the course they are applying for. One application per student is required and you can support up to ten students in your school.

 

To complete the supporting application select the link below:

<%= @student.full_name %> <%= @path %>

If you are not in support of the student's application we ask that you log in and select "no" to this question which is at the start of the application. 

To help you keep track of the students from your school who have applied you can access the application status page. This gives you a list of students who have applied and allows you to view their submitted application.

Once your supporting application is submitted no further revisions or re-submissions can be made. We may contact you to verify some of the details in your supporting application.

Thank-you for taking the time to consider students for E12.
