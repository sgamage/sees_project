Dear <%= @student.full_name %>,

 

Thank-you for submitting an E12 application. Remember to be eligible for E12 you need to ensure the following:

    * You submit an EAS application with UAC if you are not attending one of the identified schools 
    * Your Principal must submit a supporting application
    * You should your E12 selected course as your first preference on your UAC application

 

Your Principal has been notified of your application and can view the details, you donâ€™t need to provide them with a copy.

 

We will be in contact with you in <%= @student.created_at%> to confirm whether or not you have been shortlisted and if you need to attend an interview. It's a good idea to keep a saved copy of your application so that you can refer to it if you are shortlisted.

 

Kind Regards,
