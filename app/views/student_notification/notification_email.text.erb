Dear <%= @student.full_name %>,

 
Thank you for submitting an E12 application. Remember to be eligible for E12 you need to ensure the following:

    * You submit an EAS application with UAC if you are not attending one of the government identified schools 
    * Your Principal must submit a supporting application
    * Make sure you put your E12 selected course at the University of Sydney as your first preference on your UAC application

 

Your Principal has been notified of your application and can view online details and attachments submitted, you donâ€™t need to provide them with a copy.

We will be in contact with you shortly to confirm whether or not you have been shortlisted and if you need to attend an interview. It's a good idea to keep a saved copy of your application should you need to refer to it in the future.

 

Kind Regards,
Student Recruitment Team
